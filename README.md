# HapticFPS

A first-person shooter game developed for my bachelor's thesis in computer science at University of Milan (UniMi). This game was designed to provide an immersive experience using haptic feedback with the Novint Falcon device.

You can [PLAY](https://chri-sp.itch.io/hapticfps) this game on itch.io.

Note: Due to library compatibility after updating to Unity 2022, the haptic device used in this project is no longer supported.
